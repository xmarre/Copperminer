# Copperminer – A Gallery Ripper

A hassle-free GUI tool to recursively download full-size images from any Coppermine-powered gallery—plus other sites using a simple rules engine (ThePlace2 and LiveJournal photos included). No thumbnails, no junk—just the real full-size images, organized in folders to match the site’s gallery structure. Perfect for backing up fan galleries before they disappear.

## Features

- Point-and-click GUI — No command line needed, always-on dark mode
- Intelligent discovery — Enter any gallery root or album URL (supports Coppermine and rule-based sites like ThePlace2 or LiveJournal photos)
- Album tree — Finds and displays all real albums for selection, ignoring “Last uploads”, “Most viewed”, and other virtual/special albums
- Optional special galleries toggle — Include “Last uploads”, “Most viewed”, etc. only when you want them
- Preserves structure — Downloads images into folders/subfolders that match the gallery’s layout
- Download progress & log — See what’s happening at every step
- Select/Unselect all and Stop buttons — Quickly manage or cancel downloads
- Resizable log panel — Drag to change how much space the log uses
- 4chan support — Browse boards and threads to bulk download all attached media
- Adaptive scraping engine — Handles custom Coppermine themes, multi-page albums, custom anti-hotlinking, and referer requirements
- Smart caching engine — Saves each page and image list with ETag/Last-Modified info. Quick scans use HEAD requests so only changed pages are re-scraped.
- History dropdown — Quickly reopen recently scanned galleries from cache
- “Mimic human behavior” — Adds random pauses between downloads to avoid hammering servers (toggle in the GUI)
- Windows double-click support — via `start_gallery_ripper.bat`
- One-click self-update from Git — pull new commits and restart automatically
- Compatible with Python 3.10+

### 4chan Usage

Enter `4chan` by itself to browse all boards, or paste any 4chan board or thread URL. Double-click a board to open it. Use the **Back** button to walk back up the navigation stack. Threads show a checkmark when fully downloaded or `[+n]` for new files. After a download finishes, the tree refreshes to reflect the new status. Selecting a thread downloads all attached files (images, webms, mp4s) into a `4chan/<board>/<subject> (id)` folder structure.

## Limitations

- Supports Coppermine and a small set of rule-based sites (initially ThePlace2 and LiveJournal photos): other galleries may fail
- No thumbnails or junk: heuristically skips thumbnails and UI icons to save only the original images
- Not for commercial use: See license below
